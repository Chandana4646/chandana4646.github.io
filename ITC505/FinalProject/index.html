        <b>Adendum</b>
        <br>
        This document describes the development process, creative choices, and challenges encountered during the
        creation of the Lights Out game. It also highlights the insights gained along the way.
        <br><br>
        <b>Development Process:</b>
        <br>
        Initial Setup: The first step involved structuring the HTML and CSS files for the game layout and styling.
        <br>
        JavaScript Logic: The core functionality was built through JavaScript functions for:
        <br>
        Board creation and square initialization.<br>
        Square toggle on click and adjacent squares flip.<br>
        Win condition check and click count display.<br>
        Random board generation with backtracking to ensure solvability.<br><br>
        <b>Testing and Debugging:</b> The game logic was thoroughly tested and debugged to ensure smooth gameplay and
        accurate
        win detection.
        <br><br>
        <b>Creative Choices:</b>
        <br>
        Visuals: A simple and clean design was chosen to focus on gameplay and avoid distractions.<br>
        Click Count Display: Adding a click counter adds an additional element of challenge and accomplishment.<br>
        Win Message Customization: The win alert message was personalized to include the number of clicks for a more
        satisfying experience.<br><br>
        <b>Challenges and Solutions:</b>
        Win Condition Optimization: Initially, the win condition checked for all squares to be off, which could be
        inefficient. Optimizing it to check for only one remaining light greatly improved responsiveness.<br>
        <b>Insights Gained:</b><br>
        JavaScript DOM Manipulation: The development process deepened understanding of manipulating DOM elements through
        JavaScript, including creating, styling, and adding event listeners.<br>
        Game Design Considerations: The project provided valuable insights into game design principles, such as
        balancing difficulty, providing clear instructions, and incorporating feedback mechanisms.<br><br>
        Overall, the development process of the Lights Out game was a valuable learning experience, allowing for
        exploration of new concepts and refining existing skills. The final product serves as a fun and challenging game
        that demonstrates the power of JavaScript and game design principles.
